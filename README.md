## DAX (Formulas Used in Measures)

### 1. Total Casualties â€“ Current Year and YoY Growth

**(a) CY Casualties Measure**
```DAX
CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])
```

**(b) PY Casualties Measure**
```DAX
PY Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
```

**(c) YoY Casualties Measure**
```DAX
YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]
```

### 2. Total Accidents â€“ Current Year and YoY Growth

**(a) CY Accidents Count Measure**
```DAX
CY Accidents Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), 'Calendar'[Date])
```

**(b) PY Accidents Count Measure** 
```DAX
PY Accidents Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))
```

**(c) YoY Accidents Count Measure** 
```DAX
YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents Count]-[PY Accidents Count])/[PY Accidents Count]
```
